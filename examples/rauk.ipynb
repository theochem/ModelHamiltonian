    "So far the Hamiltonians treated by the documentation have been focused in carbon chains. With this new update it is possible to work with different atoms, using the Rauk's table or the distance beetween the atoms with the Wolfsberrg-Helmholz aproximation.\n",
    "\n",
    "To generate a Hamiltonian with atoms different from carbon, simply apply the same logic as before: Define a list of tuples with the atoms indexed by the position of their respective site in the compound. The new module of the library has two main purposes:\n",
    "\n",
    "1) If you define the system using atoms different from carbons and the connectivity as ``integer`` numbers, the program will assign to the one body term the $\\alpha$ and $\\beta$ precomputed based on the Rauk's table.\n",
    "\n",
    "2) If you define the system using atoms different from carbons and the connectivity as `float` numbers, the program will assign to the one body term the $\\alpha$ and $\\beta$ computed using the Wolfsberrg-Helmholz approximation, based on the provided distance.\n",
