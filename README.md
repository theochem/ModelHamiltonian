# Model Hamiltonian

This utility generates 1- and 2-electron integrals corresponding to various model Hamiltonians. The basic input is some indication of connectivity, either explicitly or as a lattice. One then specifies the Hamiltonian of interest. The output are 1- and 2-electron integrals in a format convenient for use in other (external) software packages. Notably, these integrals can be transformed into FCIDUMP format using [IOData](iodata.qcdevs.org).
